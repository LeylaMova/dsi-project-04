# Indeed Salary Predictive Model
---

![](images/jobhunting.jpg)

### Project Description

In this project, I built a prediction model for the salary of a Data Scientist using Indeed job ads. This model can bring more transparency to the hiring market; improving user experience searching for jobs, and help employers and jobseekers figure out the market worth of different positions. 

Aggregators like __[Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/)__ regularly pool job postings from a variety of markets and industries. I set out to determine what factors most directly impact data science salaries effectively and accurately.
